Hello, this project is an sample CQ5 project I built for training purposes.  This project contains a
structure I find useful for CQ5 development and deployment.  The website built in this example is
nothing special but I do try to use best practices I have picked up over the past couple years
building CQ projects.  This is built using CQ 5.6.1 as the base.  i have not tried using AEM 6 yet.
